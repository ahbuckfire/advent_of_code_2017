# Advent of Code
This is a project for me to practice python and think through brainteasers from advent of code.

## To Run
To run the puzzle on a specific day, run `python runner.py -day <day>` from the root directory. Currently works for days 1 to 7

## Structure
* Every day is specified as `day_<day>.py` and contains a `run` function to run the code.
* `fixtures/` contains my user-specific input data from advent of code
* `utilities/` contains utility functions for reading in different input formats and printing the output nicely
